‚ùó | **This project is used for a python major assignment, personal work during freshman year, and may have some usefulness for other projects (will be explained clearly in the board afterwards) If there is any infringement, please contact me to remove it.**
:---: | :---
‚ö†Ô∏è | Because it is an assignment, so this project to show and record mainly, this is my first attempt to develop front-end, basically for learning as we go, the project omission must be a lot of places, welcome to correct! Once again (only for learning, if it involves copyright and other issues, the author immediately delete the warehouse to run away!)

## Introduction
The project is a **song preference analysis system** that crawls a specific user's Netflix data, performs the relevant processing and then visualises the data on a web page. It also includes recommending artists and song lists to users based on their preferences, as well as analysing the artist's listener user profile. There is a lot of private stuff in the project, ~~please use caution~~

## Deployment

The information below may be tedious and boring, and may even contain errors, so I hope you will forgive me.~~Easy peace for dalao!‚ïÆ(‡πë‚Ä¢ÃÅ ‚ÇÉ‚Ä¢ÃÄ‡πë)‚ï≠~~
+ The content of the deployment is divided into two sections, please read them carefully.
  
### Music 163 api deployment
The project uses the NetEase cloud api as part of the crawler, ensuring the stability of the real-time crawler while reducing the stage of user configuration of the crawler.
> For a detailed configuration process please [see here](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi)

Please ensure you have/complete the following capabilities/things before deploying:
- Node.js / JavaScript Fundamentals
- Basic error reading skills
- ~~To put it bluntly, it's really just a matter of configuring the node environment (üòì)~~

<details>

  <summary>Brief deployment process (click to expand)</summary>

  #### Install
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi.git
$ cd NeteaseCloudMusicApi
$ npm install
```

  #### Running
```shell
$ node app.js
```

The default port for server startup is **3000**, if you do not want to use port **3000**, you can use the following command : **Mac/Linux**

```shell
$ PORT=4000 node app.js
```

On **windows**, use a terminal such as **git-bash** or **cmder** to execute the following command .

```shell
$ set PORT=4000 && node app.js
```

The default host for server startup is **localhost**, if you need to change it, you can use the following command : **Mac/Linux**

```shell
$ HOST=127.0.0.1 node app.js
```

On **windows**, use a terminal such as **git-bash** or **cmder** to execute the following command .

```shell
$ set HOST=127.0.0.1 && node app.js
```
</details>

### Celestial Music Deployment

The project is using **python 3.10** and I don't know if a lower version will have any problems. A virtual environment for **py 3.10** can be created with the following statement

```shell
conda create -n music_work python=3.10
```

All are very common libraries that can be installed via pip. However, it is recommended to use a virtual environment~
> pip list
```shell
pip install pandas flask bs4 html5lib Jinja2 lxml requests jieba 
pip install wordcloud imageio matplotlib numpy
```
If there is anything you haven't covered, just pip when you get an error

## Start-up process

1. Firstly, referring to what we saw in Deployment 1, we cd to the NeteaseCloudMusicApi directory and run the following:
```shell
node app.js
```
A successful run is indicated when the following appears:
```powershell
server running @ http://localhost:3000
```

2. Open a new terminal, cd to the project folder, open the virtual environment and run the following:
```shell
python app.py
```
A successful run is indicated when the following appears:
```shell
* Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://localhost:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```
Visit [here](http://localhost:5000) in your browser (click here again once it has run successfully!!!)

## Tutorials for using the website

1. **Entering the initial login screen users can log in using their NetEase cloud id:**
   - If the user id entered is normal you can enter the user interface, **Note** because the data are crawled on site so you need to wait a while, you can check the crawling process on the **app.py** terminal.
   - Please be patient during the crawling phase ~~it's not a bug that hasn't been solved yet~~
   - If you enter the wrong user id you will be redirected to the **42** error URL ~~here's the egg~~
   - If the crawl fails, it will go to the **25252** error screen

2. **On entering the user interface, the user can view basic operational information:**

4. **Search Artist board:**
   - The search board allows you to search for an author based on their id
     - If the id is incorrect, you will be taken to the **42** error page.
     - If the crawler fails to run it will go to the **25252** error page, you can check the progress of the crawler in the terminal

![](img\search.png)

5. **Recommend To You board:**
   - Recommended Songs 1~4 suggest four songs that the current user may like, based on the recommendation system of NetEase Cloud. It is based on NetEase's recommendation system. It is obtained by searching through the tag and related categories of the music the user often listens to.
   - Recommended Songs 5~8 Same as above
   - Singer Hit Song Hot Reviews recommends 10 songs and shows the tags of the songs.

GithubÔºö [guanchazhe_spider](https://github.com/hunter-lee1/guanchazhe_spider) Although there is no reference to the code of this project, the lesson above was recommended on this project, so I will put this project up as well ~~I didn't get through this one.(‚Ä¢‡∏¥_‚Ä¢‡∏¥)~~

GithubÔºö [NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi) This project references some of the functionality of this project, in order to ensure the stability of the real-time crawler crawl, while reducing the burden of filling in cookies and useragent for the user

HTMLÔºö [Á´ôÈïø‰πãÂÆ∂](https://aspx.sc.chinaz.com/) This project uses web templates from this website, all of which are free resources. The actual design of this project has been heavily redacted from the original sample website and is largely original except for the framework.

README:  [JAVClub](https://github.com/JAVClub/core) The README for this project is written with reference to some of the README content of the project, sorry for the author's first time writing a README. ~~Don't care about why it's this one!~~

EchartsÔºö [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/index.html) Most of the visualisation solutions within this project are provided by echarts, and two JS files, echarts.js and bmap.js, are referenced in the project.

miHoYoÔºö [miHoYo](https://www.mihoyo.com/) The interface of this project contains some graphics from three games of MihaYu, especially the virtual image of "Silver Wolf", which will be removed immediately if there is any infringement. ~~dddd~~
